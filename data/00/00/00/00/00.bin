  |   Welcome to PixARK, a vast, wild world filled with vicious             |
  |   dinosaurs, magical creatures and endless adventure! To survive in     |
  |   this mysterious land, you must tame creatures both ferocious and      |
  |   cuddly, craft high tech and magical tools, and build your own base    |
  |   out of cubes.                                                         |

  |   With a robust character creator, an infinite number of voxel based    |
  |   maps and procedurally generated quests, your PixARK adventure will    |
  |   be completely unique. Team up with friends to form a tribe, or play   |
  |   on your own. Spend your time building a towering fortress or go on    |
  |   a quest in a sprawling cavern. Fly on the back of a dragon and        |
  |   smite your enemies with a magic wand, or ride a mighty T-Rex and      |
  |   blast your foes with a rocket launcher. In the world of PixARK, how   |
  |   you play is up to you - as long as you survive!                       |
  |                                                                         |
